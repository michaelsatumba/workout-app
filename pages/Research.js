                        For our design research we sought out friends, family and close acquaintances and had them fill out a
                        survey. In terms of data we wanted to get we wanted both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative
                        data such as if people prefer working out alone or with people, if people use workout apps and such. Our
                        qualitative data would include something like having the participant describe what their ideal workout app
                        would be. After gathering this data using Google forms we would organize it on a Miro Board and discuss it
                        with each other to find any patterns or things of interest. We would also use the data Google Forms gave
                        us to give us a general quantitative idea of our data, such as what percent of participants prefers to
                        workout alone, or what percent of participants would like fitness trainers. After developing a prototype
                        using the data we would then send it to some users to test it. We would ask the user to record themselves
                        using our website to see how they interact with the prototype. With the recording we would find areas
                        which the user struggled with in our prototype in hopes of improving it.
